        <h1>Rebecca</h1>
        <p> I'm a versatile content creator based in Toronto, Canada. By profession, I specialize in graphic design,
          typography, art direction, photography, and UI design. My diverse skill set was honed during my academic
          journey at Toronto Metropolitan and the University of Toronto. I've tackled a range of projects, from
          editorial spreads to website wireframe prototyping, all while adapting and applying my creative
          expertise.</p>

            <h3> Travelling</h3>
            <p>By far one of my favourite hobbies (and the most expensive), but also so rewarding. Having
                spent summers in Germany growing up, my love for traveling and experiencing new places and
                cultures started at a young age.</p>

            <h3>Photography</h3>
            <p>I love capturing moments and feelings on camera. I focus on editorial work, and particularly
                love portraiture. I find capturing an individuals unique beauty is such a creative form of
                storytelling..</p>

            <h3>Staying Active</h3>
            <p>I grew up as a dancer, I spent my winters on the slopes with my siblings and friends on our
                boards, and transitioned into rep soccer in the summers. I still love being active just as
                much now, as I did back then. </p>

          understanding of user-centered design principles, I can create intuitive and engaging
          digital interfaces that prioritize user satisfaction and accessibility. My proficiency
          in conducting user research, usability testing, and wireframing enables me to design and
          optimize websites and applications to meet the unique needs and preferences of diverse
          user groups. I'm also adept at information architecture and interaction design, which
          helps in crafting seamless and enjoyable user journeys. Overall, my UX skills empower me
          to deliver exceptional digital experiences that leave a positive impact on users and
          drive business success.</p>

        <h3>User Interface Design</h3>
        <p>My user interface (UI) experience skills are a key asset in my toolkit. I have a
          strong grasp of designing visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces that blend
          aesthetics with functionality. Through a keen eye for detail, I can create
          pixel-perfect layouts that ensure a consistent and cohesive user experience.
          Proficient in UI design tools and best practices, I specialize in crafting
          interactive elements, user flows, and intuitive navigation that enhance the overall
          usability of digital products. With a focus on responsive and accessible design, I'm
          dedicated to making sure that interfaces not only look great but also work
          seamlessly across different devices and platforms. My UI experience skills are
          instrumental in delivering polished and engaging user interfaces that leave a

          editing and manipulation, enabling me to create stunning visual assets and enhance

          brochures and documents. Illustrator allows me to create intricate vector graphics
